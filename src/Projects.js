Additionally, O-ring sizing and black powder force calculations were performed\n 3D modeled all the parts and assemblies in SolidWorks\n3D printed and assembled parts and ground tested three times to ensure consistent operation\nFlight tested the piston on a high-powered rocket", "versionOne":"Cylinder easily susceptible to fatigue\nBulkheads deflect significantly during actuation, which takes energy from the system and reduces performance\nCharge canister threads are susceptible to snapping off\nThe piston assembly can only output 130lbf with 0.3 grams of black powder","versionTwo":"Used mechanics of materials to increase cylinder thickness to reduce stress and fatigue at screw hole locations\n Made SolidWorks part drawings and machine bulkheads out of 6061-T6 aluminum to reduce deflection upon separation \n Charge canister size was increased to prevent the threads from snapping off and to allow for greater internal pressures with standard operation at 1000psi\nPiston assembly can output 200lbf on 0.125 grams of black powder"},
    {"name":"Level 2 High Powered Rocket", "goal":"Design, fabricate, and fly a level two high-powered rocket for certification","imageSrc":"/images/highPowerRocket.png","design":" Simulated the rocket in the software OpenRocket\nAssembled parts using epoxies and fasteners to ensure sturdy structure\n Preformed FEA on bulkheads and machined them out of 6061-T6 aluminum\nPreformed ground testing to ensure rocket separation can occur under pressure increase from black powder charges\nPreformed a certification test and flight to get certified to fly and purchase rocket motors with impulse classes J, K, and L","versionOne":null,"versionTwo":null},
